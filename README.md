The project inspects several methods for the
multiclass classification of animal species in wildlife images
captured by trap cameras. The best method was K-Nearest
Neighbours with an accuracy of 76% for VGG16 feature extraction method. The Parzen Window, Logistic Regression, SVM and
Artificial Neural Network methods were tested and the results
were 64%, 65%, 48% and 50%, respectively, using VGG16 as the
feature extraction method. Other methods of feature extraction
were tested (DenseNet121 and ResNet50) and VGG16 showed a
better performance overall.
